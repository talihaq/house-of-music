Project Learning Log 

Hello,

This is an example of a simple, responsive website made with Bootstrap. It's a very slightly tweaked version of the Museum of Candy project from Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp. 

The purpose of the project was to utilise Bootstrap to create a responsive website that looks great across a range of display sizes. A little JavaScript was used for the navigation bar. 

I changed the theme from candy to music, sourced my own images from Unsplash (credit below), changed the colour scheme and switched the lollypop icon image to a Bootstrap vinyl icon instead. 

Skills: Bootstrap
